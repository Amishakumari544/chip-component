# Chip Input Component

## Specifications

This React component implements an auto-suggest chip input field with the following features:

- Clicking on the input field reveals a dynamic list of items.
- As you type, the list updates to display only matching items.
- Clicking on an item transforms it into a chip at the top, automatically adjusting the input field.
- Converted chips are removed from the list.
- Each chip includes an "X" icon for removal, returning the item to the list.

## Bonus Task

- Implementation follows clean code principles.
- Developed using TypeScript for enhanced type safety.
- Special handling when the input is blank:
  - Pressing backspace highlights the last chip.
  - A subsequent backspace press deletes the highlighted chip.

## Implementation Details

- Developed in React (CRA/NextJS) from scratch.
- Utilizes CSS solutions such as Tailwind CSS/SCSS for styling.

## How to Use

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the development server: `npm start`
3. Access the component in your application and enjoy the intuitive auto-suggest chip input experience.
